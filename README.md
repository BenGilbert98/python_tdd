## Why do we use TDD?
- To make sure the code is functioning properly before it is shipped
- Helps us minimise the risk of failure before sending product to production

## Steps
- Create a file to write our tests
- Create a file to write test code
- Run the tests (it will fail)
- Refactor and add code to pass the tests
